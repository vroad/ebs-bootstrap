# ebs-bootstrap
A utility for attaching and formatting EBS volumes. Useful for bootstraping EBS volumes on EC2 instances in a single-instance ASG.

The code is mostly from [monzo/etcd3\-bootstrap](https://github.com/monzo/etcd3-bootstrap). Renamed to `ebs-bootstrap`, as it could be used for any services that need persistent storage.
